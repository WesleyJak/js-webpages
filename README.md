# js-webpages

My first project using nodejs, expressjs, ejs to make some dynamic webpages.

## Why?

I have an interest in crafting my own websites for personal purposes such as a resume or CV site to show my work. Learning the whole technology stack of interactions is a passion of mine, even if not directly applicable to the work I'm doing at the moment. 

## Technologies

Javascript-based frameworks were used in this. Nodejs and expressjs for serving the websites (as I understand it now). Incorporated some css and html. Assembled the websites making ejs template. 

## Process

This project was not of my own conception, but results from looking up multiple tutorials and piecing code together to create something that works. A few variables were played with to test the interactions and see what changes affected what parts of the result.

## What did I learn?

For my own progression, I've found that simply restating and writing out what I did helps to solidify knowledge. I learned how to start a server with node, then how to use npm to start the server (modifying my own json file for scripts), and lastly using nodemon for an easy updating experience while coding. 

Next, showing some content with the server started; Initially text and variables, later some hard-coded html, lastly including another html file to serve. I learned that this method as is would be sufficient for a static webpage, but my goal is to create something dynamic, which seems the more useful thing to do. This led me in the direction of researching about ejs. Eventually I pieced together some code and made a simple login page as well as a page to pull the repo of a github user. Looking back at this now, it would be useful to have a form where the user inputs their user name (instead of just '?username=<username>' format).

I will not be coming back to this project. Instead, I will take what I learned from here and attempt to create something of my own for the next project (Link below in the future).
